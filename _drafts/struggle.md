I used to hate struggling. I used to be afraid it. I used to loathe going through hard times. So I went out of my way to avoid difficult times and in the process, I missed so many opportunities. Then I realized that the struggle was never going away.

Struggle is human and raw. We can't cheat it. From the moment we are born we are meant to struggle. A baby struggles out of its mother's womb, it struggles to walk and it struggles to say its first words. Struggle is part of us. When we struggle, we are truely ourselves, naked in the face of adversity. Only then, we can begin to work on our limits, flaws and realize our strengths.

Struggle is beautiful. It breaks the chains holding you back and it turns you into a new and better person.

So rather than reject it, embrace it.
