description : One aspect of entrepreneurship that is often neglected, is the increasing emotional toll it takes on you over time. You give up on a regular social life while your friends climb up the social ladder. You go through rejections, betrayals, backstabbing, failures again, again and again... but you brush those away because you have to keep going, your team depends on you.

One aspect of entrepreneurship that is often neglected, is the increasing emotional toll it takes on you over time. You give up on a regular social life while your friends climb up the social ladder. You go through rejections, betrayals, backstabbing, failures again, again and again... but you brush those away because you have to keep going, your team depends on you.


The reality is that all of these keep adding up, slowly eating away your enthusiasm and your optimism, filling you up with despair and fear and actually turning you into an empty person.. You have no one to turn to, because none of your loved ones understand what you are doing. What if they were right ? Why don't you get a regular job anyway?

Despite being surrounded by so many people, you feel alone. You go back to work because that's all you really have anyway; that, your talent and that little bit of hope left. The hope that as long as you keep working hard, things will be allright... it will all fall into place one day.
